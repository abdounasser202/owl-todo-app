# owl-todo-app

I followed the step-by-step Odoo's tutorial about OWL but in this repo, we have a folder for components.

Here is the link: https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/learning/tutorial_todoapp.md

If you want to start a new OWL project with NodeJS, feel free to use this link:

## Running the project


- install npm

- type ``` npm install ```

- and then ``` npm run dev ```
